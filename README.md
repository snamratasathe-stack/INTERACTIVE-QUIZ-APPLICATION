*DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT*:The Interactive Quiz Application is a frontend-based web application designed to provide an engaging and user-friendly platform for conducting online quizzes. This application allows users to answer multiple-choice questions, receive instant feedback, track their progress, and view their final score at the end of the quiz. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the effective use of core frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while maintaining proper file structure and connectivity.

This application runs completely on the client side and does not require any backend or database. All quiz-related data and logic are handled using JavaScript, making the application lightweight, fast, and easy to deploy. It is ideal for educational purposes, practice tests, online assessments, and frontend development learning.

HTML is used to create the basic structure of the application. It defines the quiz layout, including the question display area, multiple-choice option buttons, timer section, progress bar, and navigation between pages. The application uses multiple HTML files, such as the quiz page and the result page, which helps maintain a modular and organized structure.

CSS is used to design and style the application. It enhances the user interface by providing attractive color schemes, button hover effects, responsive layouts, and visual feedback for correct and incorrect answers. CSS also improves usability by ensuring the application looks clean and professional on different screen sizes. Animations and transitions make the quiz more interactive and engaging for users.

JavaScript plays a crucial role in controlling the functionality of the application. It dynamically loads questions from a separate JavaScript file, handles user input, manages the timer for each question, checks answers, updates the score, and controls the quiz flow. JavaScript also updates the progress bar and stores the final score using localStorage, which allows data transfer between the quiz page and the result page without using a backend.

The application works in a simple and logical manner. When the quiz starts, questions are loaded one by one. The user selects an answer, and immediate feedback is provided by highlighting the correct or incorrect option. After completing all questions, the user is redirected to the result page where the final score is displayed, along with an option to restart the quiz.

This application is easy to handle because of its clean folder structure, separation of concerns, and readable code. New questions can be added easily, and the design or logic can be modified without affecting other parts of the application. It can be extended further by adding features such as category selection, leaderboard, login system, or backend integration.

References used for developing this application include MDN Web Docs, W3Schools, JavaScript documentation, and frontend development tutorials. Overall, the Interactive Quiz Application is a practical, scalable, and beginner-friendly project that demonstrates essential frontend development skills.
